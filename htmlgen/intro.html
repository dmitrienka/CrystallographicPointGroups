		<h2>Welcome to the magnetic point groups web site!</h2>
		<p></p>
		<p>This site provides a series of still images and movies showing the regular and magnetic point groups as 3D rendered objects. To generate the images, we use the POVray rendering package; all scripts used to create the images/movies, as well as all the scripts needed to create this entire website, are available from <a href="https://github.com/marcdegraef/MagneticPointGroups" target="_blank">GitHub</a>; simply fork the repository, clone it to your own computer, install a few programs and execute the top scripts described in the README file. </p> 
		<p></p>
		<p>For details on the underlying math and physics, please refer to the following paper: M. De Graef, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-010-0171-0" target="_blank"><i>Visualization of time-reversal symmetry in magnetic point groups</i></a>, Met. Mat. Trans. A, <b>41</b>, pp. 1321-1329 (2010). A similar article was published as <a href="https://www.iucr.org/education/pamphlets/23" target="_blank">Teaching Pamphlet #23</a> by the <i>International Union of Crystallography</i>.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>For each point group, there are a number of rendering options available: [CPG=crystallographic point group, MPG=magnetic point group]</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>raw stills:</b> These images only show the symmetry elements, without any objects, for the 32 CPGs.  </li>
		<li><b>scalar stills:</b> 32 CPGs with a scalar object, i.e., a sphere</li>
		<li><b>scalar movies:</b> Similar to scalar stills, but with the whole object rotating around its axis</li>
		<li><b>anaglyph stills:</b> 32 CPGs with a scalar object rendered as red/blue stereo anaglyphs</li>
		<li><b>pseudoscalar stills:</b> 32 CPGs with a pseudoscalar object, i.e., a righthanded helix</li>
		<li><b>pseudoscalar movies:</b> Similar to pseudoscalar stills, but with the whole object rotating around its axis</li>
		<li><b>polar stills:</b> 32 CPGs with a polar object, i.e., an arrow</li>
		<li><b>polar movies:</b> Similar to polar stills, but with the whole object rotating around its axis</li>
		<li><b>axial stills:</b> 122 MPGs with an axial object, i.e., an arrow</li>
		<li><b>axial movies:</b> Similar to axial stills, but with the whole object rotating around its axis</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>All still images and movies are available in tar.gzip compressed format via the &quot;Archives&quot; menu link.</p>
