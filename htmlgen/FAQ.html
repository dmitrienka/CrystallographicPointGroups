		<p id="Q1"><b>How many of these groups are there?</b></p>
		<p>There are 122 magnetic 3D point groups; they are sub-divided into three classes: 32 crystallographic point groups, 32 gray (or non-magnetic) point groups, and 58 two-color (or black-white) groups.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p id="Q2"><b>Why are there differently shaped objects in these renderings?</b></p>
		<p>In the <b>raw</b> case, only the symmetry elements are shown, without any objects. In the <b>scalar</b> case, the object is a sphere; spheres do not have handedness, so they look the same, whether we look at them directly or via a mirror.  The <b>pseudoscalar</b> objects have handedness, i.e., they can be left-handed or right-handed; we use a helix consisting of a series of small spheres to clearly depict the change of handedness for mirrors and the inversion center.</p>
		<p>The most complex object used for the renderings is a vector. There are two types of vectors: <b>polar</b> vectors and <b>axial</b> vectors. For polar vectors, we only need to use the 32 crystallographic point groups.  For the axial vectors, though, all 122 magnetic point groups need to be considered, since an axial vector is not invariant under time-reversal symmetry.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p id="Q3"><b>What do the colors of the symmetry elements mean in the stills and movies?</b></p>
		<p>The colors of the various objects in the stills and movies have special meanings that depend on the type of object:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Rotation axes:</i> For the crystallographic point groups, each rotation axis has a differently colored end object: 2-fold = <font color="yellow"><b>yellow</b></font>, 3-fold = <font color="green"><b>green</b></font>, 4-fold = <font color="red"><b>red</b></font>, and 6-fold = <font color="blue"><b>blue</b></font>.  The same convention is used for the polar vector case.  For the magnetic point groups, regular rotation axes are drawn in <font color="blue"><b>blue</b></font>, whereas time reversing axes are depicted in <font color="yellow"><b>yellow</b></font>. For the gray groups, every symmetry element has its time reversing version in the group as well, so we represent all rotation axes in <font color="gray"><b>gray</b></font>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Mirror planes:</i> For the crystallographic groups, the mirror plane is rendered as an actual mirror object, so it appears as a shiny object in the raw, scalar, and pseudoscalar renderings.  For the polar case, the mirrors are drawn slightly darker, and in the axial renderings they are either blue for regular mirrors or yellow for time-reversing mirrors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Inversion center:</i> For the crystallographic groups, the inversion center is drawn as a <font color="yellow"><b>yellow</b></font> sphere. In the axial case, a <font color="blue"><b>blue</b></font> sphere represents a regular inversion, and a <font color="yellow"><b>yellow</b></font> sphere a time-reversing inversion.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p id="Q4"><b>What do the colors of the polar and axial vectors mean in the stills and movies?</b></p>
		<p>For the polar case, there are two possible colors for vector objects: <font color="white"><b>white</b></font> and <font color="magenta"><b>magenta</b></font>.  The reference vector is always represented by a <font color="white"><b>white</b></font> symbol, and any vector that is related to the original vector by an operation with spatial parity of -1 will be represented in <font color="magenta"><b>magenta</b></font>.</p>
		<p>For the axial case, there are four possible colors: <font color="white"><b>white</b></font>, <font color="magenta"><b>magenta</b></font>, <font color="blue"><b>blue</b></font>, and <font color="cyan"><b>cyan</b></font>.  Once again, the <font color="white"><b>white</b></font> vector is the reference vector. There are two relevant parities: spatial parity and temporal parity, and the pair is represented by two integers that can each take on the values +1 and -1. A regular rotation does not change the handedness (i.e., spatial parity +1) and does not reverse time (i.e., temporal parity +1); the equivalent vectors for this (+1,+1) case are depicted in <font color="white"><b>white</b></font>. For a regular mirror plane we have (-1,+1) and the color changes from <font color="white"><b>white</b></font> to <font color="magenta"><b>magenta</b></font>.  For a time reversing rotation we have (+1,-1) and the color is <font color="cyan"><b>cyan</b></font>. Finally, for a time-reversing mirror plane we have (-1,-1) and the color of the vector is <font color="blue"><b>blue</b></font>.</p>
		<p>Finally, for the axial vectors in the 32 gray magnetic groups (i.e., groups whose symbol ends in 1'), each vector is simultaneously multiple colors, so we represents it as a two-headed vector in <font color="gray"><b>gray</b></font>.</p>
